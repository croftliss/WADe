        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies are incresingly popular alternatives for online payment since they enable secure online payments without 
        the use of third-party intermediaries. But before converting traditional currencies into 
        cryptocurrencies the users should search for information regarding the currency wanted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CryK (Cryptocurrency Knowledge Manager) is a micro-service-based web application capable to show 
        and manage information regarding cryptocurrencies (e.g. name, trading symbol, total coins, block target time, 
        hashing algorithm, date launched, URL of the source code repository, URL to the official page). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This catalogue of coins will use semantic web technology. This approach takes advantage of the attendant power and 
        flexibility of representation in order to improve ease of re-use. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) will be used in this project
        in order to define a structure of knowledge for our main domain and more.

        <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p> 
                Our project is a web application which provides interactive services that can be accessed by web browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Frontend</h3>
                The front end representing our catalogue of coins will be built using Angular. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Backend</h3>
                The back end includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Main (Cryk) Api and Semantic Api, both will be written in Python using Flask.</li>
                    <li>Crawler for gathering data from DOACC written in Python</li>
                    <li>Ontology Query Service which will use the library rdflib in order to work with RDF and SPARQL queries.</li>
                    <li>A wrapper around SPARQL service, sqparqlwrapper, to execute our queries.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>  
    </section>
    <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The project consists of multiple services, for frontend, developed using Angular, and for backend, written in Python. The backend has 2 APIs, one for SPARQL and one with a more general purpose, running at the same time, on different ports. The APIs are built using Flask.
        </p>
        <section id="diagram">
            <h3>Diagram</h3>
            <p>
                The application follows a very simple architecture, from a frontend client, the actions done by the user call different endpoints in 2 APIs, one with a more general purpose (generate data for visualizations based on SPARQL queries), and the other one, a semantic API that is more of a wrapper for SPARQL that has a bunch of queries ready to be used on our onthology obtained from <a href="https://doacc.github.io/">DOACC</a>.

    <section id="ontology">
        <h2>Ontology</h2>
        <p>
            The choice of the ontology language to utilize in a particular situation must be made before beginning to create an ontology-based system. For our project, we have used the <u>Ontology Web Language</u> (OWL) format mainly because our data for creating the ontology was acquired through <a href="https://doacc.github.io/">DOACC</a> project and these files came in the above mentioned extension. The tool used to create the ontology was <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protege</a>, a free, open-source ontology editor.

            <h3>
                Model
            </h3>
            <p>
                We created two ontologies in order to make the most accurate description of a cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <h4>CCY</h4>
            <p>
                Our ontology model is described as in the following illustrations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The complete graph: <img src="images/ccy_graph.png"/></li>
                <li>The arc relations between entities: <br> <img src="images/ccy_arc_types.png"/></li>
                <li>The prefixes: <img src="images/ccy_prefixes.png"/></li>
                <li>The most relevant metrics of the vocabulary: <img src="images/ccy_metrics.png"/></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section id="api">
        <h2>APIs</h2>
        JumpyBugs implemented the APIs using Flask, due to its simplicity in launching a very simple server, capable of accepting multiple requests of different methods (POST, GET), accessing the request's data, handling user cookies, and having an easy way in which responses can be send back as JSON.
        <section id="semantic-api">
            <h3>Semantic API</h3>
            <p>
                The semantic API works as a wrapper for SPARQL queries. Each endpoint has assigned a query, and when it is called, it will return the response as JSON. The queries are ran against our ontology obtained from <a href="https://doacc.github.io/">DOACC</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="cryk-api">
            <h3>CryK API</h3>
            <p>
                The CryK API works as a multi-purpose API, capable of generating and formatting the data accordingly to how the visualizer will require its input. 
            </p>

    <section id="linked-data-principles">
        <h2>Linked Data principles</h2>
        <p>
            Our implementation follows the four rules of the Linked Data Initiative:
            <ol>
                <li>Use URIs as names for things ✓</li>
                <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names ✓</li>
                <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL) ✓</li>
                <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things. ✓</li>
            </ol>
            We are using HTTP URIs for every thing presented on the website, so a person or a machine can explore more data. We are also using them in order to identify resources by exposing several endpoints in our API.
            As for the format and service standards, we are using the OWL format, which defines the ontology, and, moreover, expose a SPARQL service in order to provide a way of querying our database. 
            When clicking on an altcoin, we also included links to other related crypto currencies.
